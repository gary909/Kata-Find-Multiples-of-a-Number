    <h1>Kata: Find Multiples of a Number</h1>
    <p>
        In this simple exercise, you will build a program that takes a value, integer , <br>
        and returns a list of its multiples up to another value, limit . If limit is a <br>
        multiple of integer, it should be included as well. There will only ever be positive <br>
        integers passed into the function, not consisting of 0. The limit will always be <br>
        higher than the base.<br>
        <br>
        For example, if the parameters passed are (2, 6), the function should return [2, 4, 6] <br>
        as 2, 4, and 6 are the multiples of 2 up to 6.<br>
        <br>
        If you can, try writing it in only one line of code.<br>
